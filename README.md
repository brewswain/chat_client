# React Chat Client using sockets.io

## Purpose

This project was made with the intent of learning to understand how WebSockets work, as they're of particular interest to me for some future potential projects. This means the more basic implementation where the live-chat is the main focus is the approach used in this project. This also means that code may be more frequently commented wherever socket.io is used, as this is meant to be a quick reference point for me.

## Technologies used

- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
